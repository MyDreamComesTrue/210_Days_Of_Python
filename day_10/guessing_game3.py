Purpose: Purpose: The program randomly selects a number between 0 and 10
7 and stores it in the variable `secret` without displaying it to the user.
It then prompts the user to guess the selected number. If the user
guesses correctly, the program displays 'You won!'. If the guess is incorrect,
it displays 'You lost! The correct number was ' followed by the value of `secret`.
